# Tutorial
In Connect the Current, you have to rotate power lines so power reaches to all of the houses.
- Every line has to be connected on all of it's sides.
- Every power source and house must have at least one connection
- Houses dont share electricity, like power lines.
- When needed, you might have to create loops of power or branches with no house linked to them. 
(This is also because it's randomly generated and i couldn't find a way to generate maps with no meaningless branches)
- To rotate a line, just click on it and it will change its rotation.
- Maps are randomly generated, difficulty(size, source count, house count) depends on what you pick and grows exponentially.
